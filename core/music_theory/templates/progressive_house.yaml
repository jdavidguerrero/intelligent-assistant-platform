# Progressive House — harmonic template
#
# Aesthetic: euphoric, building, anthemic. Major and minor modes.
# Clear functional harmony with dominant resolutions, but avoids being
# overly "poppy". Often uses flat-VII (Aeolian borrowed chord) for lift.
# Seventh chords throughout; occasional add9 for brightness.
#
# Reference artists: Eric Prydz, deadmau5, Chicane, Daft Punk
