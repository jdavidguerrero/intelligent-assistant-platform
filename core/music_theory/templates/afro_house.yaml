# Afro House — harmonic template
#
# Aesthetic: percussive, tribal, joyful, rooted. Dorian and natural minor modes.
# Progressions are short (2-bar) and highly repetitive — rhythm and groove over
# harmonic movement. Modal interchange between Dorian and natural minor common.
# Simpler voicings — triads and open fifths to leave space for percussion.
