# Melodic Techno — harmonic template
#
# Aesthetic: cinematic, driving, emotional. Minor modes predominant.
# Progressions are repetitive but emotionally charged — often 2-bar motifs
# looped 4–8 times. Builds tension before a single harmonic resolution.
# Extended and modal chords preferred; phrygian colour used occasionally.
#
# Reference artists: Tale Of Us, Recondite, Moderat, Stephan Bodzin
