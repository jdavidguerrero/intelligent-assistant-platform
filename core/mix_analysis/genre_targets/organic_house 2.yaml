# Organic House — mix target profile
#
# Aesthetic: earthy, warm, hypnotic. Deep sub-bass presence, natural mid range,
# restrained top end. Not overly bright or compressed.
# Reference artists: Fur Coat, Hoj, Patrice Bäumel, Âme

genre: organic house

# Frequency band targets (dB relative to overall RMS)
# Positive = that band is louder than average, negative = quieter
bands:
  sub: -6.0        # 20-60 Hz: deep but not boomy
  low: -4.0        # 60-200 Hz: warm bass presence
  low_mid: -8.0    # 200-500 Hz: controlled, not muddy
  mid: -10.0       # 500-2kHz: recessed (not mid-forward)
  high_mid: -12.0  # 2-6kHz: smooth, not harsh
  high: -16.0      # 6-12kHz: present but not bright
  air: -22.0       # 12-20kHz: subtle air

# Problem detection thresholds (how many dB above/below target triggers detection)
thresholds:
  muddiness_db: 3.0    # low_mid excess
  harshness_db: 2.0    # high_mid excess
  boominess_db: 4.0    # sub+low excess combined with low crest
  thinness_db: 4.0     # low_mid deficit

# Stereo image targets
stereo:
  overall_width_min: 0.30   # minimum acceptable stereo width
  overall_width_max: 0.85   # above this = overly wide / phase risky
  low_width_max: 0.15       # lows should be centered (< this)
  high_width_min: 0.35      # highs should be reasonably wide

# Dynamics targets
dynamics:
  lufs_min: -10.0     # minimum acceptable integrated loudness
  lufs_max: -6.0      # maximum (louder than this = over-compressed)
  crest_min: 8.0      # minimum crest factor in dB (more headroom = more dynamic)
  crest_max: 16.0     # above this = very dynamic (may sound inconsistent in a mix)
  peak_max_db: -0.5   # true peak ceiling (dBFS)
