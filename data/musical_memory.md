# Musical Memory Model

An intelligent instrument should remember aspects of a musician's behavior.

## Candidate Memory Signals

- Preferred BPM ranges
- Common rhythmic density
- Velocity distribution
- Scale usage
- Harmonic tension patterns

## Learning Loop

Observe → Aggregate → Learn → Deploy → Validate

Personalization emerges from memory combined with inference.

Data becomes the long-term moat of the system because it reflects
unique player behavior that competitors cannot replicate.
