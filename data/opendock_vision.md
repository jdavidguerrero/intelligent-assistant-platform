# OpenDock — Intelligent Musical Instrument

OpenDock is an intelligent hardware platform designed to augment musical performance without removing human control.

## Core Principles

- Latency must remain under 10ms for performance-critical decisions.
- Edge intelligence handles gesture recognition.
- Cloud intelligence handles learning and personalization.
- Offline mode must remain fully playable.

## Example Decisions

### Edge Mandatory
- Velocity curve adjustment
- Pad hit classification
- Aftertouch modulation

### Cloud Advantaged
- Player style modeling
- Pattern suggestion
- Adaptive scale recommendations

## Anti-Goals

- No autoplay features.
- No AI replacing musician intent.
- Intelligence must feel like extension, not automation.
